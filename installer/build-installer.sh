# Build a distributable .pkg installer for SpyBand.
#
# MUST RUN ON macOS: pkgbuild, productbuild and codesign are Apple's, and none
# of them exists anywhere else. Build the plug-in first, then run this.
#
#   ./setup-xcode.sh --no-open && cmake --build build --config Release
#   installer/build-installer.sh
#
# The result is installer/SpyBand-<version>.pkg, which installs
#
#   /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/SpyBand.vst3
#   /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/SpyBand.component
#
# as two separately choosable components, so somebody who only wants one
# format gets only that one.
#
# SIGNING - read this before sending the result to anyone:
#
#   With no arguments the payload is ad-hoc signed and the .pkg is not signed
#   at all. That installs fine on THIS machine and is fine over AirDrop or a
#   USB stick. A .pkg DOWNLOADED from the internet is quarantined, and an
#   unsigned, un-notarised one is refused by Gatekeeper - the person has to go
#   to System Settings -> Privacy & Security and allow it by hand, which is
#   exactly what an installer from an untrusted stranger looks like.
#
#   For real distribution you need BOTH halves of a Developer ID and a
#   notarisation:
#
#     installer/build-installer.sh \
#       --sign-app       "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" \
#       --sign-installer "Developer ID Installer: Your Name (TEAMID)" \
#       --notarize       project6-notary
#
#   where the profile was stored ONCE, in the keychain, with
#     xcrun notarytool store-credentials <profile> \
#         --apple-id you@example.com --team-id TEAMID --password <app-specific>
#
#   It is not per-project: the profile holds an Apple ID and a Team ID and
#   nothing else, so whichever one you already have notarises this too.

#
#   .../SpyBand.component/Contents/Resources/plugin.vst3
#       -> /Users/<you>/DXi-DEv/SpyBand-VSTi/build/VST3/Release/SpyBand.vst3

# That is right for development - rebuild the VST3 and the AU follows - and it
# is fatal in an installer. Copied as-is onto another machine the symlink
# dangles, the wrapper finds nothing to load, and the AU fails to instantiate
# with no useful error. A .pkg built by pointing pkgbuild straight at the
# build directory has exactly this bug and looks perfect until somebody else
# tries it.
